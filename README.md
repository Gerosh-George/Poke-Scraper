# Pokedex
The data structure that is used in implementing Pokedex is hash table, actually a more generic form of it which is Dictionary (key-value pairs DS).

The data collected/scrapped is stored in form of JSON, which is a open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs.

## Hash Table
In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

- Search: O(1)
- Insert: O(1)
- Algorithm: Average
- Space: O(n)
- Delete: O(1)


A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.

## Dictionary (Python)
A dictionary is defined as a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. A dictionary is associated with a set of keys and each key has a single associated value. When presented with a key, the dictionary will simply return the associated value.
