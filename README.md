The data structure that is used in implementing Pokedex is hash table, actually a more generic form of it which is Dictionary (key-value pairs DS).

The data collected/scrapped is stored in form of JSON, which is a open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs.
